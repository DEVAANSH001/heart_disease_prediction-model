# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction System

## üè• Project Overview
*A machine learning system that predicts cardiovascular disease risk with 95% accuracy using patient health metrics*


## üîç Key Features
- **Multi-Model Comparison**: Evaluates 6 ML algorithms for optimal performance
- **Clinical Metrics**: Processes 13 critical health parameters
- **Explainable AI**: Provides risk factor analysis alongside predictions
- **Deployment-Ready**: Simple web interface for medical staff

###  Workflow Summary

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   We started by cleaning and preprocessing a medical dataset containing various features such as:
   - Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type
   - Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar
   - ECG Results, Max Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina, and more.

2. **Model Training**  
   We trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models:
   - **Linear Regression**
   - **Naive Bayes**
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - **Decision Tree**
   - **Random Forest**

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   We compared all models using the following metrics:
   - **Accuracy**
   - **Precision**
   - **Recall**
   - **F1 Score**

   We also analyzed:
   - **Underfitting** (model too simple, high bias)
   - **Overfitting** (model too complex, high variance)

4. **Best Model Selection & Saving**  
   Based on evaluation, the **Random Forest** model performed the best.  
   - We saved it using **Pickle** for later use in deployment.

5. **Deployment with Streamlit**  
   We built an interactive **Streamlit** UI where users can:
   - Input patient data through a simple form
   - Get real-time predictions on heart disease risk
